Possibilities:
- Should harmonic work like this instead?: There are generating intervals, and each generating interval comes with a distance. The distance to a note is the shortest harmonic distance found.
- Arc the interval lines?
- In rectilinear, make the draw order follow the distance from the viewer, i.e. sum of terms like  n2*np.log(2) * k * np.sin(phi). What should the draw order be when it's not rectilinear?

Next:
- Could we give up drawing open-ended steps? Would simplify things. (Would it?) Besides, the gradients for them are wrong anyway, since they always draw as if the rel_hn of the endpoint is 0, even though it could be negative. Actually, even drawing steps to tones outside the viewbox is problematic, since those tones may not be generated. There's more thoughts in a TODO note in the .js.
- Make all settings be part of the URL.
- Make Settings collapsible.

- Add a dropdown menu with preset options.
- Make all reasonable settings part of Settings.
- Add buttons for adding and removing axes and generating intervals.
- Make a button for hiding/showing all or some of the intervals.
- Add tick-boxes for including inverse generating intervals.
- Style Settings with nice fonts etc.
- Add a dial with three options: No names; note names (A, F#, etc.); intervals (fractions). Have them float next to the buttons, maybe directly above.
- Add a volume slider.
- Make the background color adjustable, and set it to black by default.

- Visualize the vertical gap being adjusted when changing y-shifts?
- Implement the help/info page/overlay.
- Write Help documentation. One global one, but maybe also smaller ones for various subparts of Settings.
- Before the first note is played, show the following tooltip, or something like it: "Click or poke red dots to play them. The stronger the red the closer harmonically that tone is to the base tone, circled in black. Click ? for more info."
- Add a horizontal axis that shows frequency, and/or maybe tone names.
- Implement vertical zoom.
- Reposition the zoom slider(s) to be along the axes of the canvas somehow.
- Put limits on horizontal zoom at the hearing thresholds.
- At the bottom, create a whole functional piano keyboard? Make it collapsible.
