2/1     octave

Possibilities:
- Should harmonic work like this instead?: There are generating intervals, and each generating interval comes with a distance. The distance to a note is the shortest harmonic distance found.
- Arc the interval lines?
- In rectilinear, make the draw order follow the distance from the viewer, i.e. sum of terms like  n2*np.log(2) * k * np.sin(phi). What should the draw order be when it's not rectilinear?

Next:
- Add buttons for adding and removing axes and generating intervals.
- Visualize the vertical gap being adjusted when changing y-shifts?
- Make all reasonable settings part of Settings.
- Make a button for hiding/showing all or some of the intervals.
- Make Settings collapsible.
- Add tick-boxes for including inverse generating intervals.
- Style Settings with nice fonts etc.
- Make resizing the window make the canvas scale.
- Implement the help/info page/overlay.
- Write Help documentation. One global one, but maybe also smaller ones for various subparts of Settings.
- Add a dial with three options: No names; note names (A, F#, etc.); intervals (fractions). Have them float next to the buttons, maybe directly above.
- Make all settings be part of the URL.
- Before the first note is played, show the following tooltip, or something like it: "Click or poke red dots to play them. The stronger the red the closer harmonically that tone is to the base tone, circled in black. Click ? for more info."
- Add a volume slider.
- Make a hovering bubble that shows a two-sentence guide before the user plays something.
- Add a horizontal axis that shows frequency, and/or maybe tone names.
- Implement vertical zoom.
- Reposition the zoom slider(s) to be along the axes of the canvas somehow.
- Put limits on horizontal zoom at the hearing thresholds.
- At the bottom, create a whole functional piano keyboard?
- Make the background color adjustable, and set it to black by default.
