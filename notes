Possibilities:
- Should harmonic distance work like this instead?: There are generating intervals, and each generating interval comes with a distance. The distance to a note is the shortest harmonic distance found.
- Arc the interval lines?
- In rectilinear, make the draw order follow the distance from the viewer, i.e. sum of terms like  n2*np.log(2) * k * np.sin(phi). What should the draw order be when it's not rectilinear?

Next:
- Add buttons for adding and removing axes and generating intervals.
- A UI element for adding and removing base tones.

- Add a dropdown menu with preset options.
- Add a dial with three options: No names; note names (A, F#, etc.); intervals (fractions). Have them float next to the buttons, maybe directly above.
- Add a volume slider.
- Make pitchlines not show under tones.

- At the bottom, create a whole functional piano keyboard. Make it collapsible.
- Add a horizontal axis that shows frequency, and/or maybe tone names. Or is this made unnecessary by the keyboard? What about when the keyboard is collapsed?
- Implement vertical zoom.
- Reposition the zoom slider(s) to be along the axes of the canvas somehow.
- Put limits on horizontal zoom at the hearing thresholds.

- Highlight the tone and the pitchline of tones that are playing.
- Make every number selector be such that when it's active, it spawns a hovering slider next to it. Get rid of ranges inputs.
- Could we give up drawing open-ended steps? Would simplify things. (Would it?) Besides, the gradients for them are wrong anyway, since they always draw as if the rel_hn of the endpoint is 0, even though it could be negative. Actually, even drawing steps to tones outside the viewbox is problematic, since those tones may not be generated. There's more thoughts in a TODO note in the .js.
- Visualize the vertical gap being adjusted when changing y-shifts?
- Could we somehow color the tones based on their prime decomposition, with each prime associated with some color?

- Implement the help/info page/overlay.
- Write Help documentation. One global one, but maybe also smaller ones for various subparts of Settings.
- Before the first note is played, show the following tooltip, or something like it: "Click or poke red dots to play them. The stronger the red the closer harmonically that tone is to the base tone, circled in black. Click ? for more info."

- Redo the representation of intervals in the UI.
- Redo the representation of axes in the UI.
- Make the linestyles of pitchlines, intervals, and base tone borders adjustable.
- Make the background color adjustable, and set it to black by default.
- Create color presets, at least one dark and one light.
- Create a checkbox for setting all the settings stuff either light or dark.
- Style Settings with nice fonts etc.

- Use more CSS classes.
- Go through TODOs in source.
- Optimize performance by storing data to avoid recomputation.
- Document and pretty the code: Maybe separate JS files, certainly a separate CSS file, ...
