Possibilities:
- Should harmonic work like this instead?: There are generating intervals, and each generating interval comes with a distance. The distance to a note is the shortest harmonic distance found.
- Arc the interval lines?
- In rectilinear, make the draw order follow the distance from the viewer, i.e. sum of terms like  n2*np.log(2) * k * np.sin(phi). What should the draw order be when it's not rectilinear?

Next:
- Make interactive using javascript
- Add a dial with three options: No names; note names (A, F#, etc.); intervals (fractions). Have them float next to the buttons, maybe directly above.
- Make all settings be part of the URL.
